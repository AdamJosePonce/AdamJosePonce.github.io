This was a small personal project that I made during Winter Quarter of my Sophomore year. The original plaque is from a car club that my Grandfather was a member of in the 1970s. The original plaque measures 15 inches in length and was aluminum casted. I modelled new plaques in SolidWorks at a smaller scale (6 inches in length) and designed it for manufacture using a water jet cutter. The plaques were cut out of a 1/4" thick aluminum plate using the water jet in Mustang 60.
