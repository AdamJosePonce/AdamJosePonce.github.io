I machined this project as part of my IME 145 course in my freshman year. The project took 2 lab days to complete and I was exposed to numerous new machines, operations, and techniques through this project. The main materials used for the screwdriver were 1 inch hex stock for the body and 1 inch round stock for the cap.

The majority of the operations were completed on the lathe and involved basic turning and facing. Operations I had learned was creating a taper using the compound slide, knurling a pattern on the part, and cutting chamfers. Some operations that were completed using a Haas CNC Mini Mill included engraving a logo on the part and machining threads on both the body and the cap. In the machining of this project, I also used a broach to cut a hexagonal hole on the end of the screwdriver to fit screwdriver bits.
