I made these projects during Fall Quarter of my freshman year as part of my IME 141 lab.

Cal Poly Keychain:
We made chemically bonded Cal Poly keychain molds with a sodium silicate binder using the cold box method. We then casted the parts in aluminum. A belt sander and a drill press was then used to finish the keychains.

Medallion:
We made chemically bonded Cal Poly medallion molds with a sodium silicate binder. We created both the cope and drag mold. We then casted the parts in aluminum. A belt sander was used to finish the medallion and a cork pad was applied to the underside of the medallion.
