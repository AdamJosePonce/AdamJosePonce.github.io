I made this project during Fall Quarter of my freshman year as part of my IME 141 lab. We made chemically bonded Cal Poly keychain molds with a sodium silicate binder using the cold box method. We then casted the parts in aluminum. A belt sander and a drill press was then used to finish the keychains.
