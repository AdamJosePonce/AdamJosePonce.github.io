This project was created Spring Quarter of my Freshman year in my IME 146 lab. We modelled the assembly using SolidWorks in my ME 130 course as we were manufacturing it in lab. The bottom base was cut out of aluminum stock using a water jet. The green acrylic drive wheel was cut and engraved using a laser cutter. The top aluminum plate was machined using a Haas CNC mini mill. The plastic handle was manufactured using an injection molder and a lathe. While manufacturing this project I learned about tolerance stacking, GD&T callouts, and critical dimension inspection using optical metrology machines.
