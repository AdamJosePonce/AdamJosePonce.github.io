title: Tau Beta Pi Bent

![Alternative Text]( {{ site.baseurl }}/images/IMG_9627.jpg )

I created this project as part of my initiation for the engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi during my winter quarter of my sophomore year. We were given an engineering drawing for the specifications of the bent, but given free reign on how to manufacture it. I modeled the project in Solidworks and designed it to be manufactured using a water jet cutter and a laser cutter. I stained the wood then cut and engraved it using a laser cutter. The aluminum border was cut using the water jet. All the components were joined using JB Weld.
