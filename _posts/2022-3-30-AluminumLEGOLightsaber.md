   I started this project during Winter Break 2021. The idea to make a life-size metal LEGO lightsaber came from my love of both LEGO and Star Wars, and my desire to machine a project using a manual lathe. The main materials used were 6061 Aluminum 3 inch diameter round stock, 1 inch square stock, and a 1-1/2 inch diameter flourescent blue acrylic rod. I went into the machine shops on campus whenever I had freetime to work on the project and it took about 6 weeks to complete during Winter Quarter 2022.
   
   I cut the stock to size using a horizontal bandsaw and proceeded to do most of the machining on the round stock using the manual lathe. During the machining of this project, I used the parting tool for the first time and I used it to create the central diameters and grooves. Additional machining was done using a manual mill and a rotary table to create a counterbore for the acrylic "blade" to sit in. The square stock was used to create the four nubs that sit around the base of the lightsaber hilt. These were machined using a manual mill and additional finishing on a vertical belt sander. I put one part of a pair of twist-release magnets in the bottom of the counterbore in the hilt and the other part of the pair at the bottom of the acrylic blade for easy attachment and detachment, while still being a strong connection. I then polished all the aluminum parts.
